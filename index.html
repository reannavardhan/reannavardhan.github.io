            <p>  </p>
            <p>I'm a high school senior passionate about the intersection of public policy and tech. Through policy advocacy and youth encouragement, I hope to better educational equity, specifically in BIPOC communities. Recently, I've been working towards that goal as the Vice Chair of Fairfax County's Student Human Rights Commission where I spearhead youth engagement with the Fair Housing Act and am the primary liaison for the SHRC Commissioners. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with various coding platforms (like GitHub!), taking every public speaking opportunity, and playing the guitar, but I'm not so great at the latter! :) </p>
